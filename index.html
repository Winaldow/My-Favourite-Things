  <p>One of my favourate things in this world is <b>sneakers</b>. Since i was young i always loved jordan, with my favourite being the jordan 4 The <b>Jordan 4</b> was the second straight shoe designed by Tinker Hatfield and was released in 1989. It wasn’t a huge departure from the 3 when it comes to design, but it made additions that make it one of the more beloved in the series. The Jumpman logo had the word “Flight” added right below it. It introduced nubuck materials to the sneaker world for the first time. There were mesh components for increased breathability and it had multiple areas that featured plastic.</p>
